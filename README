Program description:

Since we provide makefile, you can use command make to compile our code.

Since we use SSLContext and KeyManagerFactory in our code, it may show that we use deprecated API, please just ignore it.

When use our program, please type:

java WebServer --serverPort=http_port --sslServerPort=https_port

our program can provide http service and https service simultaneously.

Thank you.
